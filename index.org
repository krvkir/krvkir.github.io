#+TITLE: krvkir's weblog

Not much here for now.

Hey.

* Notes

** <2017-07-25 Tue> Jupyterlab useful links

Extensions:
- https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-renderers.git

Commands:
- all things are done via =jupyter labextension=, see =jupyter labextension --help-all= for options

** <2017-07-26 Wed> Jupyterlab: enabling ipywidgets

Finally managed to install it (see this [[https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/2485][issue]] on =jupyterlab='s github):
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
#+END_SRC

** <2017-07-26 Wed> Spacemacs: switch back to vim mode from emacs mode

It's just =ctrl-z=. This switches modes from emacs to vim and back.

** <2017-07-27 Thu> Dask progressbar with =tqdm=

Found [[https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/278][here]].

** <2017-08-04 Fri> Vimperator, customize set of symbols which appear on link hints

It's often sufficient to know the names of things to find how to handle with them:
#+BEGIN_SRC bssh
:set hintchars=qwertasdfgzxcvb
#+END_SRC
